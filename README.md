# MBot-Report

Final Report for Mbot project written in IEEE format with LaTex.

In this project, we developed a fully autonomous nonholonomic differential drive robot. We implemented a combination of feedforward and feedback control to control the motions of our robot. Additionally, we implemented a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to perceive and process our robotâ€™s environment. Furthermore, we implemented an A* search algorithm for planning paths in known environments. At large, the project encapsulates action, perception, and reasoning for a ground robot. As a result, our robot can successfully explore an unknown environment autonomously.

This repo only contains the latex files for the final report as a showcase.
